Graduated in Sistemas de Informação from PUC Minas. I have been working in the technology field since 2010. Specializing in backend development, primarily focusing on C# and .NET.

I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that allowed me to improve in different aspects and work with various types of systems such as Windows services, WCF, web applications, integration APIs, chatbots, as well as gaining experience with diverse languages, tools, and frameworks, including Entity Framework, SQL Server, Azure, WebApi, MVC, JavaScript, React, Angular, etc.

Additionally, I have experience in:

- Continuous integration using TeamCity and Octopus, as well as automation with PowerShell.
- Creating automated tests to ensure development quality, employing TDD and BDD.
- Working in agile teams using Scrum and Kanban methodologies.

In recent years, I have developed skills in leadership and agility, serving as Agile Master for support teams and project-focused teams, and as Tech Lead for development teams. During this time, I have provided leadership to teams, assisted in defining technical solutions and workflows, and supported individuals in their development.

In 2023, I transitioned to the role of Team Lead, focusing heavily on leading and managing Cloud projects at Blip.

I enjoy solving problems by developing simple and high-quality solutions.

Passionate about technology with a special interest in continuous learning.
